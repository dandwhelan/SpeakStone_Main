-- project most needs was a poor trade. It is on by default and can be turned
-- off in the settings panel.
--
-- Why capture at all: quest description/progress/completion text is delivered
-- by the server at runtime and exists nowhere in the files Blizzard ships, so
-- the only ways to get it are to read it off a live client or scrape a site
-- that already did. Gossip text is worse -- there is no gossip-text table in
-- the client either, and no scrapeable equivalent, so it can *only* come from
-- capture like this.
--
-- The standalone addon still exists and still works. If someone has it
-- installed and enabled, this module stands down entirely rather than both
-- recording the same lines into two different stores.

--- How much of a payload to put in front of the player at once.
---
--- The export goes into a game edit box for the player to select and copy,
--- and that widget is not built for a document. A store that has been
--- collecting for months serialises to megabytes -- the reminder to submit
--- fires at 250 entries and nothing prunes the store afterwards, so this is
--- the ordinary end state of an addon left switched on, not a pathological
--- one. Past some size the box stops being something a person can select and
--- copy out, and the failure is silent: the text is simply not all there.
---
--- So the payload is cut into pieces, each a complete and valid export in its
--- own right rather than a fragment that only means something reassembled.
--- The website already merges and deduplicates submissions, so pasting three
--- pieces one after another lands exactly what one big paste would have, and
--- a player who stops after the first has still sent real, usable data rather
--- than a broken half of something.
---
--- The number is deliberately conservative and has not been measured against
--- a live client -- it wants checking against a real edit box with a real
--- store behind it, and can be raised if the widget turns out to cope.

-- and the short-lived missingCaptures table this addon used before capture
-- was folded in. Both are drained on first load and then left alone, so
-- nothing a player already collected is stranded.
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Bumped when captured data has to be repaired rather than just carried
-- forward.
--   2: speaker attribution was unreliable -- see CurrentSpeaker.
--   3: the pass for 2 kept quest npcIDs. Every one of them was a zoneUID, so
--      they all had to go, not just the ones that were obviously wrong.

-- Throw away what the speaker bug produced.
--
-- Gossip goes entirely: it is keyed on the speaker, and a stale creature ID
-- merged many different NPCs into one bucket, so there is no way after the
-- fact to tell which line belonged to whom. Keeping it would mean submitting
-- lines to be voiced by an NPC who never said them, which is worse than
-- having none.
--
-- Quest text is kept -- the text itself is correct and is keyed by quest ID,
-- not by speaker. Every npcID recorded before the fix is a zoneUID rather
-- than a creature ID, though, so all of them go: a plausible-looking but
-- wrong ID is more dangerous than none, because nothing downstream can tell
-- it is wrong. npcName was always read correctly and is kept, except where it
-- is the player's own name, which is the one case that was visibly broken.
